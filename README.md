Facial Expression Detection using Computer Vision
This project focuses on detecting facial expressions from images extracted from a Kaggle dataset. The computer vision model developed is able to classify various facial expressions with an accuracy of 65%.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to extract images from a large dataset, preprocess the images, and apply machine learning techniques to detect and classify different facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, etc. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is built using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.

Features
Image Extraction: The project extracts facial images from the dataset and preprocesses them for training.
Expression Detection: The trained model classifies the expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy rate of 65%.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains labeled images of human faces representing various expressions. The dataset is preprocessed to fit the model's requirements before training.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Expression-Detection.git
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project: If you want to train the model or extract images from the dataset, simply run the provided Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Computer_Vision_Project.ipynb
How it works
Data Preprocessing: The images are first preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to improve model performance.

Model Training: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on the dataset to recognize different facial expressions.

Prediction: The model is able to predict facial expressions based on new input images.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy rate of 65% on the test set.
Performance can be further improved by using advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and using a more complex architecture.
